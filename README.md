# Battlefield VHS Packaging Scans And Nero CoverDesigner (.ncd) DVD Inlay Files

The Battlefield VHS packaging was scanned to make DVD inlays in Nero CoverDesigner. This repository contains; 1.) the Battlefield VHS packaging scans, and 2.) the Nero CoverDesiger (.ncd) DVD inlay files.

Nero CoverDesigner is used to create custom disc labels, jewel case inlays, booklets and much more for your CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. Nero CoverDesigner has been typically, but not always, bundled with Nero Platinum. Because Nero CoverDesigner was not always bundled with Nero Platinum, Nero decided to provide Nero CoverDesigner as a free standalone installer at https://www.nero.com/enu/downloads/. Scroll down the page to find it.

Screenshots of DVD inlay files opened in Nero CoverDesigner are included (NOTE: Near the bottom left of the screenshot, the DVD Inlay tab is selected. DVD Booklet and Disc 1 were not made.):
battlefield_dvd_inlay_britain_stalingrad_opened_in_neroCoverDesigner.*
battlefield_dvd_inlay_midway_normandy_opened_in_neroCoverDesigner.*

The actual Nero CoverDesigner files (.ncd) are included:
battlefield_dvd_inlay_britain_stalingrad.ncd
battlefield_dvd_inlay_midway_normandy.ncd

In short, to print the DVD inlay; 1.) install Nero CoverDesigner free, 2.) open .ncd file in Nero CoverDesigner, 3.) to see the DVD inlay, click bottom left DVD Inlay tab, 4.) click File | Paper Stocks | select your paper, and 5.) click File | Print. All three items (ie, DVD Inlay, DVD Booklet, and Disc 1) print out. The DVD Inlay prints as expected. The DVD Booklet and Disc 1 print blank outlines.

Or use the included scans to make your own.

Enjoy!
